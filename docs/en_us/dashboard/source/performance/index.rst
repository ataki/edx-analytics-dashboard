.. _Performance Index:

#############################
Student Performance
#############################

To assess how students are doing in your course, you make a selection from the
**Performance** menu. Student performance data is available in edX Insights
for problem components of these types:

* Checkboxes

* Dropdown

* Multiple choice

* Numerical input

* Text input

* Math expression input

When you select **Graded Content**, EdX Insights displays the grading
configuration for your course. You can review aggregated performance data for
assignments and problems, and then the answers that students submitted for
assigned questions.

For performance data to be available for a problem, at least one student must
have submitted an answer for that problem.

Student submissions are updated every day. The computations use the last
answer submitted by each student and received through the end of the previous
day (23:59 UTC).
